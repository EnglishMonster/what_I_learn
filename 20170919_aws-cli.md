aws-cli represents Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface.  
It is written in python code.  
We can install it with `$ pip install aws-cli`  
With this, we can manipulate almost all of the AWS.  
A AWS expert said that we should use aws-cli not AWS console because AWS console changes the layout frequently, but cli is hardly changed.
