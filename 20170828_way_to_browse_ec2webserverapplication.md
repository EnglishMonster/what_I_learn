I had thought that I had to make web server like apatch or nginx to browse on browser the web service on ec2 instance.
But it is not neccessary.
We can browse on browser easily to assign ec2 instance ip address.
Note that you should open security group so that aws allow you to connect to.
But you need to make web server when you release service on public.
