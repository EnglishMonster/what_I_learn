Docker is something like virtual environment on a OS.
It makes the same environment among developers.
Without docker we can do what is alike with virtualbox, Vagrant and so on.
But docker can make develop environment easier.

We make docker instance on OS, and we make docker image on docker instance, and we make docker container on docker image.
when you try to access to same docker container on terminal, note that the docker container you can use is different from what you want.

Docker is debian linux. so we should use apt command to install some softwares.
Any modification on docker container are discarded when you logout docker container execept for the directory you assign.
