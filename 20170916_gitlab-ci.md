gitlab is code hosting service.  
It is like github and Bitbucket but differ from some point.  
It is hosting service and open source software at the same time.  
You can make gitlab service in your own server by cloning the gitlab source code.  

gitlab-ci is Continuous Integration tool working with gitlab.  
To use it, we have to prepare another server to install gitlab runner which is build tool.
