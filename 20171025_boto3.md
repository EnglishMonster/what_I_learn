boto3 is aws sdk for pythno.  
It is very useful to call aws function in python code.  
It can copy s3 bucket, make ec2 instance or set profiles.  
But is is not always the case that Using boto3 is best way to manipulate aws.  
For example, when you want to copy the folder in s3 bucket recursively, it is easier to use awscli command.  
If you persist in using boto3, it is combursome because of extra settings.  
So it is clver to use different ways depend on the requirement.
